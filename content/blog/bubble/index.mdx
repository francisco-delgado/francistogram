Like clockwork, every week news sources update the numbers reflecting the new counts for deaths, infected, and unemployed.

All numbers increasing at exponential rates. "Unprecedented", they say.

I take a look at my personal and professional network, the numbers could not be less representative of the US as a whole on any of the counts. The overwhelming majority still have their health, their jobs, and, ultimately, a semblance of their prior life. I can't help but to feel... I don't know exactly what it is, but I'll explain.

It's not guilt or shame, but varying degrees of confusion, naivet√©, and shock.

My entire world view comes in to question.

_Have I really been living in an oasis of society so far removed from the "real" America?_

I've always known I was living in the tech bubble, give me some credit, I'm not that oblivious, but the extent to which it's removed from the majority has never been clearer.
