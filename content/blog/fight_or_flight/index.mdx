The human brain was never built for certain kinds of conditions. As humans we enjoy not being lazy but thinking lazily. it's who we are and what we do

Fight or flight happens when the brain receives a brand new signal that it hasn't processeed before

Think of a function lets call it `what_do_i_do`. You're used to seeing `a`, `b`, `c` as inputs but now you've come across a `d`. What do you do next?

It bubbles up to a higher order function, but a `d` is just too new and doesn't apply to any function you've ever written before. You have no choices left but to call `base_function(d)` that takes in any inputs and deterministically returns one of

1. Fight - `1`
2. Flight - `0`

Regardless of the result assigned, when all is said and done you now have more information for the next time. You've saw a `d` acted on one of fight or flight and have more information, the degree to which it worked, which we'll save in to `success_d` which is a decimal between 0 and 1, but tends to be closer to the extremes

What do you do next?

You first consider how often you'll encouter `d` again. For example `d == bear` and you live in the city it's pretty unlikely and decide to apply a quick fix

```ruby
def what_do_i_do(a, b, c, d):
  # other stuff before
  return success_d if d
  # other stuff after
```

or you just moved to the countryside and it's likely you'll see them again. You Google how others have dealt with `d` by calling `google(d)` weigh your bias `success_d` and update your function

```ruby
def what_do_i_do(a, b, c, d):
  # other stuff before
  return google(d) * success_d if d
  # other stuff after
```
