The human brain was never built for certain kinds of conditions. As humans we enjoy not being lazy but thinking lazily. it's who we are and what we do.

Fight or flight happens when the brain receives a brand new signal that it hasn't processeed before.

Think of a function lets call it `what_do_i_do`. You're used to seeing `a`, `b`, `c` as inputs but now you've come across a `d`.

What do you do next?

`d` is just too new and doesn't apply to any function you've ever written before. You have no choices left but to call `base_function(d)` that takes in any inputs and deterministically returns one of

1. Fight, represented with a `1`
2. Flight, represented with a `0`

Regardless of the result assigned, when all is said and done you now have more information for the next time. You've saw a `d` acted on one of fight or flight and now have more information, the degree to which it worked, which we'll save in to `bias_d` which is a decimal between `0` and `1`, but tends to be closer to the extremes e.g. it worked or it didn't

What do you do next?

You first consider how often you'll encouter `d` again which we'll call `d_t`. For example `d == bear` and you live in the city `d_t` is closer to `0` but if you live in the hills then `d_t` is closer to `1`

You look for answers on Google to understand how others have dealt with `d` by calling `google(d, d_t)`. It returns another decimal between `0` and `1` as a function of the event and how long you think it's worth for you to dig in to.

You then weigh in `bias_d` from your experience and save it in to a final `do_d` or, your duty, on how you act the next time you encounter `d`.

It'll look something like this

```ruby
do_d = google(d, d_t) * bias_d
```

as a one time operation and then we update our function to be

```ruby
def what_do_i_do(a, b, c, d):
  # other stuff before
  return do_d if d
  # other stuff after
```
