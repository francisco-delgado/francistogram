description: As a human, use your greatest asset
---

As a creator, a thinker, a doer, a human your greatest asset is your capacity to dream

Just like a child, believe you can do anything

Embrace those dreams

**Breathe life in to them**

If you feel a moral responsibility to help others then you have a moral responsibility to take us from the rubble we've created to the world in your dreams

Keep dreaming

fin.
