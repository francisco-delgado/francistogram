# Luck, a definition

According to Google luck is defined as

> Success or failure apparently brought by chance rather than through one's own actions.

I'd argue luck is deeper than that and it's possible to create your own.

# Blind Luck

When something occurs to you that you had no control over, the textbook definition for luck.

#### Examples

- Winning the lottery
- Betting everything on red
- Finding a dollar bill on the ground

# Hustle

You put in the time and work towards improving yourself everyday.

On a long enough timescale positive outcomes will come of it.

#### Examples

- Working late to get a raise
- Focusing on hobbies during to create a side hustle
- Networking with others to discover new opportunities

# Preparation

You continue to hustle and eventually your skills reach an inflection point.

You're more knowledgeable than most in a specific area and are able to easily spot opportunities.

You're at the right place at the right time and you begin to notice trends that others can't.

#### Examples

- Taking enough photos that when the perfect sunset happens you can capitalize on it
- Bartering your whole life that when it comes time to negotiate an offer you can do it effectively
- Understand enough about the internals of a company that when asked by the CEO what you'd improve you can answer confidently

# Authenticity

You continue diversify your skillset in preparation for any scenario. As a result become your own unique brand through your own unique lifestyle.

You know who you are and you own it.

You're transparent about your process and outcomes for both success and failure.

Others, knowing your talent will find opportunities and bring them to you.

They understand the skillset you possess and ask for help knowing you'll be able to execute.

Don't leave your success up to chance.

Create your own luck.

#### Be yourself.
