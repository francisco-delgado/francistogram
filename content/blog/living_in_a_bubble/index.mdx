Like clockwork, every week news sources update the numbers reflecting the new counts for deaths, infected, and unemployed.

All numbers increasing at exponential rates. "Unprecedented", they say.

I take a look at my personal and professional network, the numbers could not be less representative of the US as a whole on any of the counts. The overwhelming majority still have their health, their jobs, and, ultimately, a semblance of their prior life. I can't help but to feel... I don't know exactly what it is, but I'll explain.

It's not guilt or shame, but varying degrees of confusion, naivet√©, and shock.

My entire world view comes in to question.

**Have I really been living in an oasis of society so far removed from the _real_ America?**

I've always known I was living in the tech bubble, I'm not that oblivious, but the extent to which the life I'm living is removed from the rest of the population has never been clearer than now.
