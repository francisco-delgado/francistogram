# Apollo - My Moonshot Application

I'm applying to [Apollo's Moonshot Program](https://apolloprojects.com/)

In an effort to be fully transparent with my intentions below is the application that I will send in on 7/11

If you have any edits to suggest I'd appreciate it

This is as much my community as it is yours

### What I'm Building

I'm in the process of building a community in the cloud

Eventually, we materialize in to the real world as a charter city

I'm roughly following the outline @balajis [laid out](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273)

I'm beginning on step two, mostly through my [Instagram stories](https://www.instagram.com/francistogram/)

### Why is it Valuable

The US, while admittedly imperfect, has brought a lot of good in to the world

She's created opportunities for many. The values she was created on have allowed for those with motivation, self-confidence, and a taste for risk to uproot their lives to move here for the chance of lifting themselves, their families, and their community back home out of the system keeping them down

In 2020 we seem to have lost sight of our founding princple of **Freedom**

It's becomes a conflict between "good" and the "bad" instead of, through civil discourse, figure out what is beneficial for the entire community

If you look at the data, besides this year, the world has never been safer

Crime, on aggregate, is significantly down and yet the media portrays this narrative that everyone is at each other's throats

It seems to stem from a misguided understanding that two facts can be simultaneously true

1. Horrific injustices continue to exist in the world
2. As a society, we have been actively chipping away at those horrific injustices

This data is from the US Bureau of Justice Statistics on the [Crime in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States) Wikipedia Page

Don't misinterpret my intentions. This doesn't mean we should stop fighting the fight going on now, but rather instead of having the delta difference trigger emotions of jealousy between the "Haves" and the "Have Nots" we should let it inspire the world to come together

**Together.**

That's how we solve this

The current divide has allowed so many of us to forget that we have so much "good" in our lives

We've forgetten our family, friends, and, particularly, the community in which we exist that will love us unconditionally and catch us if we fall

I want to create this city as a safe haven for those in my community. When this house of card finally collapses I want to have the infrastructure built so that my community has somewhere to escape to. I want to be that colonizer that leaves the world they know today and start the text one

The rebirth of the United State if you will

Safety is short term goal

Equity - for everyone - is the long term goal

### Why did I Decide to Work on This

My entire life I've always been the center of my friend groups. This is true of high school, college, work but most evidently in the "real" world (the life I'm living now that I've quit my job)

Within the confines of the structure defined by these institutions I was able to sway culture and build a semblance of a community

It was not, what I'd define as, a success

Success - I'd classify as building the community I and the rest of those in it want, not just what those in power want

The problem I believe to be the process. When structure is decided on top down, on a long enough time frame it will crumble for one reason or another

Without considering feedback, both positive and negative, from those the policy affects it will always be imperfect

I want to build culture, a community, a city, and a company from the bottoms up

The grass roots approach

A community based on trust

It _has_ to, by definition, take a while to build

It cannot be done quickly as

**Trust - consistency over time**

There's no get rich quick schemes and there's no to build trust quick schemes

Luckily, my skill has always been connecting people together and I'm finally letting myself own it

Whether I realized it or not, I've been working towards this my entire life. Building relationships and friendships while never expecting anything in return and maybe it's now time I spend that social capital

"Would you like to join my city?", I will offer

The decision is theirs - not mine

_fin._
