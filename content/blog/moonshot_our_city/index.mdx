# Apollo - Our Moonshot Application

I'm applying to [Apollo's Moonshot Program](https://apolloprojects.com/)

In an effort to be fully transparent with my intentions below is the application that I will send in on 7/11

If you have any edits to suggest I'd appreciate hearing them

#### This comunity is as much yours as it is mine

## What We're Building

We're in the process of building a community in the cloud

Find like minded people across the world who hold similar values

Work together remotely to build trust in each other and the rest of the community

They will have the best chance of success

Eventually, we materialize into the real world as a charter city

## What We've Built

Roughly following the outline [@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis) has [laid out](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1269178671086006273)

### Create Instagram Community

Step one and two have mostly done through my [Instagram stories](https://www.instagram.com/francistogram/)

Instagram stories are the ideal place to cultivate a safe and social environment

#### 1. Number of Followers

I have ~1500 followers built up over the years between friend's I've made and, for a year, thinking I wanted to be a photographer with a following

I believe something around 1500 to be the sweetspot

Too many followers and others will follow just to join in the trend

Too few followers and others will quickly assume you have no value

Around this number of followers is the sweet spot as it forces someone to come to their own conclusion if I provide enough value to justify a follow

#### 2. Degrees of Separation

Everyone is one degree of separation away from me and at most two degrees away from each other

The most trusting communities will have the fewest degrees of separation between any two people

#### 3. Initial Follow Filter

Those who follow me, for the most part, I've added value to their life in one way or another

#### 4. Story Filter

Stories, more than a feed, tend to more closely represent an explicit decision to consume

Those who want to follow the content I post will continue to watch and those who don't will block or Instagram's algorithm will move me to the end of their suggested stories

#### 5. Content Filter

The stories I post tend to be mostly text

They consist of my honest thoughts on both myself and the state of the world

They are not easy to consume passively

You will either give up and eventually block/unfollow or continue to be intrigued by my thoughts and join in my journey of self discovery

#### 5. Content Creation as a Conversation

As I receive DMs I will often post the conversation publicly in my story with permission

I'll share both those in support of my point and those vehemently against it. I'll defend my opinion if I still believe it to be true and I'll admit when I've changed my mind due to new information

The transparency shows that I'm open to constructive feedback while willing to both stand up for what I believe in

It also builds social validation that others enjoy my thoughts and engage with me

#### 6. Referrals are the Only Growth Method

I've stopped posting as much in my feed and when I do I don't use hashtags

The content I post only exists as an emphemeral story

You missed it? Too bad

Those who enjoy the content will share with a friend who they believe will also enjoy it

That friend, if they come to my profile, will only be able to judge my "worth" on the stories of that day and not any history like a curated grid

It's for them to decide if they believe I can provide them with more value in the future

A follow would be making a bet on my slope, not my Y-intercept

### Communal Living

With some close friends we rented a large house outside of Las Vegas for two weeks to explore the idea of having a self-sufficient communal living arrangement

![Vegas House](vegas_house.jpg)

Everything, including costs, were shared

Some would cook and others would pick up the slack by cleaning, doing dishes, getting groceries, or any other way they felt like they could help best

We started with only two rules

1. Don't be an asshole
2. Buffet rule for justifying purchases. If you'd pay for it yourself then you should buy it

We based the living arrangement on this theory

> Optimize for the community, not the self
>
> On a long enough time scale they become the same

Which only works with friends that you trust

The two weeks gave me enough of a starting point to know what worked well and what didn't and pain points to improve in the future

## What's Next?

### Humans of the Moon

I'm starting a podcast called [Humans of the Moon](https://app.sounder.fm/shows/4907) next week

The name is a cross between [Humans of New York](https://www.humansofnewyork.com/) x [Moonshot](https://apolloprojects.com/)

Every episode will be an unedited conversation between myself and others in the community, anonymous if they wish

A safe place for us to speak our mind

To play devil's advocate

To question the assumptions of others

To admit when we don't know or lack an opinion

A place for both of us, and the community, to learn from each other about our values, philosophies on life, and our Moonshots

Talk about what we're passionate about

The work we're doing as we follow our passions

The positive effects we believe our work will have on the world

Ultimately, help the listeners see the future we see

### Continued Communal Living

My housemates and I are moving out of San Francisco in the next few weeks down to the South Bay

That's where we'll have a "home base" and, on some frequency, we'll setup more communal style "vacations" in different locations across the world with different people

Through these experiments, both as a group and indivisually, we're able to gather more information on the types of living situations, locations, and people we personally enjoy best

Then we can head back the home base to better understand what worked and what didn't and refine our preferences for our next search

### Consult Friends on their Moonshots

I've always enjoyed and am good at building something out of nothing

Zero to one, not one to N

I'm working with anyone in my community who is willing to accept my help and bringing their ideas to life

I play the role of advisor, friend, and investor I offer them access to all the forms of leverage I have access to

My connections, my skillset, and my wealth

These are leaders of tomorrow who have not yet come in to their own

Cultivate and encourage them

Provide them with a platform to actually become the leaders they are destined to be

All while being transparent with the strategy so they know it's not diabolical

## Why is it Valuable

The US, while admittedly imperfect, has brought a lot of good in to the world

She's created opportunities for many. The values she founded on have allowed for those with motivation, self-confidence, and a unique taste for risk to uproot their lives and join her for the chance of lifting themselves, their families, and their community back home out of the system keeping them down

In 2020 we seem to have lost sight of our founding principle of **Freedom**

It's become a conflict between "good" and "bad" instead of, through civil discourse, figuring out what is beneficial for the entire community

If you look at the data, besides this year, the world has never been safer

Crime, on aggregate, is significantly down and yet the media portrays this narrative that everyone is at each other's throats

It seems to stem from a misguided understanding that two facts can be simultaneously true

1. Horrific injustices continue to exist in our world
2. As a society, we have been continuously chipping away at those horrific injustices

This data is from the US Bureau of Justice Statistics on the [Crime in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States) Wikipedia Page

![Homicide Offending Rates by Race](./homicide_offending_rates_by_race.png)
![Homicide Victimization Rates by Race](./homicide_victimization_rates_by_race.png)
![Violent Crime Rates by Gender](./violent_crime_rates_by_gender.png)

My intention of the displaying the data is to reframe the current fight

Instead of having the current delta in difference between the "Haves" and the "Have Nots" trigger emotions of jealousy and anger we should let our continued progress inspire the world to work even harder together

**Together.**

That's how we solve this

The current divide has allowed so many of us to forget what we have in our life that makes us happy

Our family, friends, and, particularly, the community in which we live all of whom will love us unconditionally and be there to catch us if we fall

This city as a safe haven for anyone with aligned values to join

Have enough infrastructure built so that our community has somewhere to escape to when this house of cards collapses

A landing pad for safe entry and a launch pad for future success

#### Colonizer (noun): a plant or animal that establishes itself in an area

We want to be the colonizers that leave the world they know today and start the next one

The difference from previous colonizers?

#### Peace (noun): freedom from disturbance

**We come in peace**

We don't want to take over the world

We just want our fair share and coexist peacefully

Safety is the short term goal

#### Equity (noun): the quality of being fair and impartial

**Equity** - for everyone - is the long term goal

## Why Work on This

My entire life I've always been the center of my friend groups. This is true of high school, college, and work, but most evidently in the "real" world - the life I'm living now that I've quit my job a week and a day ago

#### Freedom (noun): The ability to choose ones commitments

My first day of "real" **Freedom** was July 4th, just a coincidence I'm sure

Having finally tasted it I want to share it with the rest of the world - anyone who is willing to try it

Within the confines of the structure defined by these institutions I was able to influence culture and build a semblance of a community

#### Success (noun): The accomplishment of an aim or purpose

It was not, what I'd define as, a success

#### Goal: To create the community all of those in it want, not just those in power

This goal is currently impossible

The bottleneck I believe to be the existing norms for deciding process

When structure is decided top down, on a long enough time frame, it will crumble

Without openly considering feedback, both positive and negative, from those a policy affects the result will always not only be imperfect, but those who have to adhere to it will only know the **what** and never understand the **why**

We want to build a culture, a community, a cult, a company, a city, a country, whatever you want to call it, from the bottoms up

The grassroots approach

#### Trust (noun): Consistency over time

A community based on trust

It _has_ to, by definition, take a while to build

It cannot be done overnight

There are no build trust quickly schemes as there are no get rich quick schemes

Luckily, my skill has always been connecting people together and I'm finally letting myself own it

Whether I realized it or not, I've been working towards this my entire life

Building relationships while expecting nothing in return

It's now time I spend that social capital

I've spent my time on them and they may want to spend their time on me

## Final Chapter

> Would you like to join our country?

I ask the world

The decision?

That's theirs - not mine.

_fin._
