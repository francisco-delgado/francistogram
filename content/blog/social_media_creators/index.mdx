I recently joined Twitter a few months ago as a news source for COVID-19 related updates. The initial intention of joining to get news instead of following my friends resulted in my entire following list consisting of people whose opinions I admire and force me to think about and question my own views.

This was so different from any other social media platform I had used before and got me thinking about the types of accounts you end up following on different platforms.

### Facebook

Family.

- **Facebook** - Family
- **Snapchat** - Friends
- **Twitter** - People whose mind you want
- **Instagram** - People whose life you want
- **YouTube** - People who entertain you
- **TikTok** - Fuck you, just watch what we show you
