Okay, I'll say it, there's been _a lot_ going on this week

I've felt it, I'm sure you have. I'd be lying to you if I said I hadn't

Pause for a second. Ask yourself, "Why?"

While I can't understand you're going through I know we can find common ground on a few questions we've been asking ourselves

How we feel about

1. Racism
2. Cops
3. Looting
4. Your friends
5. Your job
6. The media
7. The government

The list goes on but - out of respect of your time - I'll stop there

It's a lot of inputs that require our opinion right now and that's why I put them on their own line

They're all parallel to each other and **that's** the only thing they have in common

As the only joke about parallel line goes

> Parallel lines have so much in common - it's a shame they never meet

As independent the lines are of each other each thought should be too

Tension is the state of being mentally or emotionally stretched tightly

If you can't then you need to relieve the tension. Your thoughts are too tangled

"How?", you ask

Hint: Type in "remember to" in to Google
